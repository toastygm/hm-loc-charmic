Years of hate and fear have left him gaunt, haggard and looking much older than his twentyseven years of age. He has brown eyes and dark brown hair. Although he tries to project a cheerful demeanour, he is slightly paranoid and cheap with his money. He is well dressed (preferring maroon) but over-accessorized, showing his desperate desire to be accepted as one of the gentle folk. Despite his attempts to fit in, he tends to be shuffled aside in conversations.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor / Weapons:</strong> Cloth tunic, hood and leggings; leather tunic and calf boots; short sword and short bow.</p>",

He is cocky and proud of his body, wearing tight leather pants and a leather jerkin which emphasize his physique. Lynd is a darling with the ladies. Although intelligent, he talks quite slowly, appearing to pause and carefully consider every word. Lynd is definitely more capable than his cousin, but fate granted the manor to Akitt. Lynd stays for the easy money.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor / Weapons:</strong> Cloth tunic, hood and leggings; leather tunic and calf boots; hand axe, two shorkana and round shield.</p>",
