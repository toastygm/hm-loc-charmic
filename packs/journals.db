It is a relatively new manor with huge potential, and grew very prosperous under its original bailiff. But in recent years, it has become a dark and dangerous place.</p>\n<p>This module details all of the households, including interior plans of the manor; plus illustrations by Richard Luschek.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Using this module with Non-HârnMaster systems</h2>\n<p>This entire module is system-agnostic.  See the section below on NPCs for details about the residents; these details may be used to generate appropriate statistics for your game system.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Using the Scenes</h2>\n<p>A number of scenes are provided representing maps. These scenes depict both internal and external areas; internal areas are generally set at a 5-foot grid spacing, while exterior areas use much larger scaling. The following subsections describe some common elements of these scenes.</p>\n<h3>Map Notes</h3>\n<p>The scenes make extensive use of Map Notes to provide detailed description of important areas in the scenes. To view these map notes, click on the \"bookmark icon\" in the canvas toolbar. Map notes are not visible to players, only to the GM.</p>\n<h3>Text and Markings</h3>\n<p>In various areas text and or markings have been provided in the scenes to assist the GM. Generally this information is set to only be visible to the GM.</p>\n<h3>Stairs</h3>\n<p>Some stairs may have an arrow indicating the direction the stairs descend. When present these arrows are visible to all players.</p>\n<h3>Lighting</h3>\n<p>To control ambient lighting, use the \"darkness\" setting for the scene.</p>\n<p>All scenes have been setup with Unrestricted Vision Range enabled, with a Vision Limitation Threshold set to 0.7. This allows all areas of the scene to be lit during the day, but vision is limited and lights are required at night.</p>\n<p>Internal lamps and candle lights have been placed in indoor areas. These lights have been set to enable when the \"darkness\" setting is ≥ 0.2, that is, just after things start becoming dim.</p>\n<p>Hârn has a cool climate, so all fireplaces and braziers are constantly lit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Recommended Modules</h2>\n<p>The following modules, although not required, are highly recommended to enhance this module:</p>\n<p><strong>Compendium Folders: </strong>Due to the large number of journal entries in this module, these journal entries have been organized into sub-folders using Compendium Folders.  If Compendium Folders is not used, these will all show up as a single long list of Journal Entries in the compendium.  As long as you follow the links starting with the _Overview journal entry, it should not be necessary to navigate the compendium, but if you want to navigate through the Journal Entries yourself, having Compendium Folders will greately simplify this task.</p>\n<p><strong>Backgroundless Pins:</strong> The note icons all have a dark grey background; with this module, that background disappears.  This may increase your enjoyment of the maps.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Background Information</h2>\n<p>For historical, political, and recent events, see @Compendium[hm-loc-charmic.journals.ZmEliTNa7r9v7mPd]{Settlement Overview}.</p>\n<p>For a sketch of life in Charmic village, see @Compendium[hm-loc-charmic.journals.xwcD6712oKdxZPT9]{Charmic Village}.</p>\n<p>For HarnManor data on the settlement, see @Compendium[hm-loc-charmic.journals.Oe8B1ewYk78UCMiP]{Settlement Data}.</p>\n<p>There is far more to Koman of Torlis than anyone guesses: for details, see @Compendium[hm-loc-charmic.journals.owFvdvrbdDQzJT6N]{[38] Villein (Koman of Clan Torlis)}.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Local Map</h2>\n<p>The following locations are all depicted in the Charmic Village scene.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-charmic.journals.GafDnQ5j88ctMsnK]{[A] Manor House}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-charmic.journals.mmJU8YZN4gJtuprU]{[B] Manor Wood Lot}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-charmic.journals.aNx2DdHeSk7wAnQu]{[C] Village Common}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-charmic.journals.HgD6rUwomnijjcvw]{[D] Peonian Shrine}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-charmic.journals.RGrnBjT8Z2QJqLM4]{[E] Meadowland}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-charmic.journals.1zwlm9bz1pIGkDOO]{[F] Bridge}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-charmic.journals.8wmGyg37MWU3QCHO]{[G] Track to Zernhol Manor}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-charmic.journals.nYObOPamI3gB9jAa]{[H] Road to Umbrea Manor}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-charmic.journals.w2K6gQyVJHXFb6To]{[I] Timberwright's Yard}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-charmic.journals.rqNEKzRTdp8wiP6i]{[J] Demesne Farm}</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Timberwright's Yard</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-charmic.journals.m2FprhjCX1XAG2Cq]{[T1] Tool Shed}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-charmic.journals.xgZPCm7hGQ4YKzG2]{[T2] Timberwright’s House}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-charmic.journals.hUrOCmU9nQFTp7V9]{[T3] Drying House}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-charmic.journals.trNFqgeEGoXbgoUR]{[T4] Sawpit}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-charmic.journals.rmX7nKyb5JQrRq5L]{[T5] Sawdust Pile}</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Manor House</h2>\n<p><strong>Bailiff:</strong> @Compendium[hm-loc-charmic.journals.3cza1PzefasoghBW]{Sir Peart Tanush, Temporary Bailiff}</p>\n<h3>Manor Servants</h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#191813\">There are currently only three servants at the manor: the cook, one domestic (see [M7]) and a stable boy (see [M5]).

He is well known to the people of Charmic and could do a great deal to help set things to right. The other domestics were fired by Lord Akitt for being too expensive. Most of them still live in the village. They would be more than happy to return to their old jobs, if they could be convince the new lord is better than the old one (not a difficult task, especially if the new bailiff hired Adilan as his

{"_id":"ZmEliTNa7r9v7mPd","name":"Settlement Overview","content":"<h1>Settlement Overview</h1><p><strong>Location:</strong> Nephshire, Kingdom of Kaldor<br /><strong>Holder:</strong> Bailiff<br /><strong>Liege:</strong> Earl of Neph, Curo of Gardiren<br /><strong>Population:</strong> Village 194; Manor 7</p>\n<h2>Geographical Details</h2>\n<p>Charmic is a moderate sized fief in northern Kaldor, held as a personal fief by the Earl of Neph under a temporary bailiff, Sir Peart Tanush. The fief is only sixty-five years old, having been created by the previous Earl of Neph in 655TR as a new manor on which to settle a number of villeins from his other estates. Although located only five leagues south-east of Gardiren, Charmic is in a relatively isolated area, bounded on all sides by woods. The large Kirsta Forest to the south is a wild and forbidding place, full of wolves and brigands. The village sits next to a small stream which forms the boundary between Dobraine and Kirsta Hundreds. The manor is in a pleasant valley bottom with fine soil and moderate climate. All crops grow well and the estate has great potential.</p>\n<p>The manor is at the end of the road from Gardiren. There is substantial traffic on the road up to the quarry a half a league away. From there, the road turns into a narrow, muddy track. Those unfamiliar with the route to Charmic Manor might well think the road is a dead end. The only other road from Charmic leads east to Zernhol Manor. The people of Zernhol prefer to take the road via Erwund Abbey to Gardiren. The Laranian abbey is rich and powerful and their road is well maintained and patrolled. The woods around Charmic have a bad reputation.</p>\n<p>The bailiff owes the Earl £115 82d per year in feudal payments plus one Heavy Horse and four Light Foot. Due to the previous bailiff’s relationship to the Earl, the military obligation has been rendered as scutage (£7 48d per year). The manor has paid its full account of £122 130d each mid-summer’s day for the last five years.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Clan Morfan were made the Bailiffs of Charmic manor in 685TR. Originally a minor clan, their dedication and loyalty greatly impressed the Earl of Gardiren. Their leader, Sir Geleyn, was very devoted to his duties. He over saw the construction of a large and comfortable wooden manor house, a substantial palisade and several new buildings during his tenure as bailiff. With the Earl’s permission, he expanded the amount of cleared land and established over a dozen new households.</p>\n<p>Sir Geleyn was well liked by the tenants. He was a fair and just lord. He worked tirelessly to improve the manor and expected the same of his tenants. He was responsible for recruiting a metalsmith and woodcrafter to compliment the miller.</p>\n<p>An enthusiastic hunter, he and his three sons hunted out virtually all of the wolves and bears in the area, to the great relief of the peasants. His regular patrols discouraged bandits and brigands, while his efficient manor courts resolved most minor legal problems quickly and to the general satisfaction of the population.</p>\n<p>From 685 to 715TR, the manor grew significantly. Sir Geleyn was prompt with his feudal obligations (both military and financial) and the Earl’s Steward was much impressed, resulting in a steady rise of the status of Clan Morfan within Earl Curo’s court during those thirty years. Therefore, few were surprised when the Earl granted Umbrea and Warial manors to Clan Morfan in 715TR. These two manors had reverted back to the Earl on the death of the last member of the Clan Thuen and their award to Clan Morfan was seen as a reflection of the Earl’s satisfaction with their loyal performance as Bailiffs and their worthiness to be permanent landholders.</p>\n<p>During the summer of 715TR, Clan Morfan held a final manor court to say farewell to their tenants before leaving for Umbrea Manor. In addition to the departure of the family, they also took their men-at-arms and two yeomen families who followed them to their new holding.</p>\n<h2>The Bastard</h2>\n<p>The present Earl’s father was a man of lusty appetites, even in his later years. He fathered several bastards, including Akitt Llack. Akitt was acknowledged and lived with his mother in one of the Earl’s townhouses until the Earl died when he was twelve. His father’s widow hated him and ordered he and his mother immediately expelled from the only home he had ever known.</p>\n<p>On the death of the Earl’s widow a decade later, Akitt was brought back to court. With his mother dead, Earl Curo wanted to ensure his half-brother was taken care of, be he baseborn or no. However, the life of the timbewright’s apprentice had ill-prepared Akitt for the life at court and he soon made a fool of himself.</p>\n<p>Anxious to rid himself of an embarrassment, the Earl made Akitt bailiff of Charmic manor, a rich fief on the edge of his domain. Thinking he was being quite magnanimous, Curo sent Akitt off to the wilderness without recognizing the humiliation, rage and hate boiling in his veins.</p>\n<h2>The Dark Years</h2>\n<p>Akitt’s arrival in Charmic was unremarkable. He came with only a couple of men-at-arms (mercenaries) and his cousin Lynd (a timberwright). This was a far cry from the large household previously supported by the Clan Morfan.</p>\n<p>Within a week, the peasants began to sense things were going to change. Almost immediately, Lynd began to explore the area, looking at stands of timber. When he began to blaze large oaks in the King’s forest (outside of the manor boundaries), the Woodward, Muir, became quite concerned and went to the new Bailiff. Far from supporting the Woodward’s concerns, Akitt became extremely angry and told Muir that if he ever questioned Lynd’s again, he would be beaten. The two mercenaries then threw Muir out of the hall.</p>\n<p>The next rest day, Akitt summoned Witol the Reeve. He informed him that the King had granted him the right to as many oaks as he wished from unsettled land. He held up a writ with many seals and signatures in front of the illiterate man and told him that Lynd had already marked out the first trees to be cut.</p>\n<p>For the rest of the summer and through the fall, the villagers cut trees. A new road was cleared, but the people were suspicious when they were ordered to only cut the largest trees, and never ones visible from the fields or road. The trees were felled and the logs transported to a new cutting yard, built in the middle of the village. The villagers spent many days cutting the logs into beams under the direction of Lynd, a ruthless task master.</p>\n<p>So much logging was being done that normal fief maintenance suffered. Again, Witol approached Lord Akitt. He asked the bailiff to give him enough men to do normal repairs to the manor, roads and fences. He was flatly denied and was barely allowed enough men and time to bring in the harvest. Despite the lack of maintenance, Lord Akitt took every fee and tax he was due.</p>\n<p>Wagons from the timberwright’s guild were regular visitors to the manor. The guildsmen were welcomed warmly by Lord Akitt and Lynd and many lavish feasts were held for them. Lord Akitt dismissed most of the staff who had worked for Sir Geleyn, but the few remaining servants reported that the guild master gave Lord Akitt many heavy pouches that he kept a large iron-bound chest in his room. The Bailiff kept the only key around his neck at all times.</p>\n<p>Normally, winter is a time of rest for the peasants. The first winter under the new Bailiff was a rude change. Lynd drove the men mercilessly. Up before dawn for the long walk out to the logging area, the men worked right until last light before returning, exhausted, to their homes. The constant heavy labour left the men hungry. Under the rule of Clan Morfan, the men could have at least expected a good meal in the manor hall, but under Lord Akitt, they were left to live off of their own meagre stores of food. By spring, all of the households were hungry and short of food. Starvation was only averted by an early spring.</p>\n<p>As expected, the winter took a toll on the manor. With the coming of spring, Witol the Reeve again approached the Lord with plans to repair the winter damage and catch up on the maintenance that had not been done the previous fall. This time, for questioning the Bailiff’s priorities, Witol was beaten by the men-at-arms for his insolence and driven from the hall. Immediately following the completion of spring planting and a bare minimum of other vital tasks, the men were again ordered to return to logging.</p>\n<p>The pattern of ignoring fief maintenance and using every spare man to log the King’s forest continued for five years. In 717, Lord Akitt sacked the Reeve and replaced him with Jodoin, a cowardly yes-man who gladly enforced the Bailiff’s every command without question. Witol, who had so loyally served the Clan Morfan for thirty years, was stripped of his land when his son tried to run away. The boy was dragged back and cruelly beaten. He never recovered and died the following winter. Witol was reduced from villein to cottar and now struggles to feed his wife and remaining son.</p>\n<p>Throughout this time, Akitt and his cousin got richer and richer, filling the first chest and adding two more. Each year, the tenants hoped and prayed that the Earl’s Steward come to Charmic and discover Lord Akitt’s cruel actions and remove him. He never arrived. Little did they know that the Bailiff faithfully paid the Earl exactly the same payments as Clan Morfan had for the last thirty years, and so the Steward saw no need to check up on the Earl’s own half-brother.</p>\n<p>The harvest of 719TR was very bad. Despite this, Lord Akitt took his full share (most of which he sold at a handsome profit), leaving virtually nothing for the peasants. Faced with starving parishioners, Charmic’s Peonian priest could take no more and slipped away in the night to take word to the Earl. After walking all day, the priest arrived at the Earl’s castle in the middle of a feast. He convinced the guard to call the Steward out of the hall and informed him what was happening. When the Steward relayed the news to the Earl he summoned the village priest before him, questioning him in detail. Then, the Earl summoned the local Peonian priest from Gardiren to confirm the man was indeed from Charmic. Determined to convince the Earl, the village priest fell to his knees and swore a holy vow on the sacred relic of Peoni. Convinced by the man’s honesty, Earl Curo was furious and declared “the ungrateful wretch”, Akitt Llack, outlaw.</p>\n<p>As he hurried through the town of Gardiren, the village priest was recognized by one of Akitt’s “business partners”, Naviel, who realized they would all hang when the Earl found out what was happening. Naviel rode to Charmic to warn Akitt while the Earl was busy interrogating the priest. In a flurry of activity, the bailiff, his halfbrother, two mercenary guards and Naviel rode out of Charmic in the middle of the night, only hours ahead of the Earl’s guards.</p>\n<p>None of the five men have been seen since. Earl Curo has posted a large reward for the capture of these men so he can try them for corruption and theft. They also face Royal charges of theft, for cutting the King’s trees without leave.</p>\n<h2>Current Affairs</h2>\n<p>The corrupt bailiff, Akitt Llack, is gone. The Earl has sent a temporary bailiff, Sir Peart Tanush, and five men-atarms to secure the manor and to salvage what can be salvaged. Sir Peart has temporarily relieved the tenants of all other duties but their work in the fields in hope of producing enough food so the villagers can survive the winter. He is taking stock of the manor house and other improvements on the fief. What he sees is not good. Once the harvest is secure, he will make what temporary repairs he can.</p>\n<p>Sir Peart has made a preliminary report to the Earl. He has recommended that a new permanent bailiff be appointed as soon as possible. He recommended it be a man of action, as there is much work to be done. Currently secured by Sir Peart and his men, the village is safe, but the woods are filled with outlaws and wolves are roaming the manor by night. Several villagers have been attacked even within the limits of the village itself. The new bailiff will need to hunt down these wolves and put an end to the outlaws, not a task for a bureaucrat.</p>\n<p>Whoever takes on the job will have a great deal of maintenance to catch up on and hostile villager’s to deal with. However, a skilful negotiator may be able to win concessions from the Earl, such as relief from feudal payments for a few years, to help pay for the repairs.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PusKspNsRtwjEZQs":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":400000}}}

It has fortyone households consisting of 34 unfree serfs (13 villeins, 9 half-villeins, and 12 cottars), one free farmer, three guildsmen, two yeomen and one priest of Peoni.</p>\n<p>The village grew up along the main road. The Peonian church was built later and now the village is expanding along the road to the mill. The square is the centre of the village and the two of the guildsmen have their homes opening onto it. The mill is a rare Kaldoric example of a wind powered mill. Wind power was chosen due to the unpredictable volume of water in the stream and the steady breeze that always flows down the valley. The manor house is built along the banks of the stream and a moat, now rather silted, encircles it.</p>\n<p>The community consists of six main clans and a number of individual families. Lord Akitt used the clan ties to great effect, meting out punishments against the whole clan to force them to keep their own members in line. Few will runaway or rebel when their aunt or grandmother will be killed in retribution. Those without clan ties were even more vulnerable as they had no one to turn to for assistance or support. Most ended up becoming yes-men and lackeys for Lord Akitt out of shear survival. The three craftsmen (miller, metalsmith and woodcrafter) would normally have been safe from the worst excesses of the lord of the manor, but Akitt was ruthless to the point of demanding hostages every time they left the manor. He also sent one of his lackeys along with them to report their every move. Lord Akitt and his men kept a tight rein on everything that happened in the village, including killing one boy and taking the arm of his father for standing up to them.</p>\n<h2>Economics and Agrarian Life</h2>\n<p>Northern Kaldor has been settled since the days of the Kingdom of Serelind. However, this manor is relatively new and is still being developed. Charmic has 2060 gross acres, 432 wooded, leaving 1628 cleared acres. Of this, 799 acres support tenants and 829 acres are demesne. Prior to the arrival of Lord Akitt, this was an very productive fief, as it sits on rich alluvial topsoil.</p>\n<p>The manor is extremely rundown. The peasants have been taxed and worked to the very limit. The manor buildings require a long list of repairs. The fief itself requires a lot of work. The roads are badly rutted and barely passable. The recent lack of maintenance and general neglect has greatly reduced its productivity. Under the rule of Clan Morfan, the manor had a fief index of 1.10. Under Lord Akitt, that value fell to 0.85, a sign of serious neglect.</p>\n<p>The manor demesne used to support a large herd of cattle and sheep, but Lord Akitt sold them off as being too labour intensive. The cattle herd has dwindled to just twelve cows and one, rather old, bull. The sheep herd is also down, though the price of wool convinced Akitt to keep forty sheep and five rams. Starvation and high taxes have thinned the numbers of villager’s animals almost to nothing. A few pigs and one or two jealously protected goats are all that remain. The people of the village are generally thin and malnourished, with a few notable exceptions, mostly Akitt’s lackeys. The villagers are downtrodden and will not meet the eye of a noble or anyone else in authority.</p>\n<p>A side effect of the starvation is fewer children or old people. Most of them died off during a series of hard winters with little or no food and the bad harvest in the fall of 719TR. The villagers hope that a new lord will find some way to get them through the winter, but it has been long since they had any hope. A new lord will have to work hard to earn their trust.</p>","img":"modules/hm-loc-charmic/assets/images/charmic-village.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PusKspNsRtwjEZQs":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":600000},"cf":{"id":"temp_vp55g1baur9","color":"#000000"}}}
