Charmic Manor is a "Location Module" for the Foundry VTT system. This location module
is designed to depict the Charmic Manor in the far north of the Kingdom of Kaldor, on
the island of Hârn in the [HârnWorld](https://columbiagames.com/harnworld/) fantasy
setting; however, this manor could be adapted to exist anywhere in any fantasy setting.

Although designed for use with the [HârnMaster](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/hm3)
system, this module is mostly system-agnostic.  Detailed descriptions of the actors
has been provided in journal entries to facilitate conversion to other game systems.

This manor is held directly by the Earl of Neph and managed by a bailiff. It is a
relatively new manor with huge potential, and grew very prosperous under its
original bailiff. But in recent years, it has become a dark and dangerous place.
